# This file contains globals shared between tests and the accelerated test
# wrapper produced by test_compile.py. When a test decorator refers to a symbol
# it must be available in the module where the decorator originally appears AND
# the generated test_compiled_all.py file. The easiest way to do this is to
# define the symbols in a common file, that both can include, hence
# test_globals.py.
#
# This does require that such globals be uniuque across ALL tests, but this is
# generally not a problem as there are few of them that appear in decorators.
