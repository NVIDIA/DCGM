= NSCQ Dynamic Library Wrapper (dlwrap)

`dlwrap` is a source code library that uses OS APIs for locating, loading, and mapping symbols from
a the NSCQ shared library. For the most part, this library simply passes calls through thread-safe
wrappers to the library APIs; they have the same names and argument lists. However, there are two
additional APIs provided to manage the lifetime of loaded library: `nscq_dlwrap_attach` and
`nscq_dlwrap_detach`.

== `nscq_dlwrap_attach`

This thread-safe function uses an OS-specific API like `dlopen()` to locate and map the NSCQ shared
library into the calling process's address space. This function will return 0 upon success, or a
negative integer (an OS-specific error code) upon failure.

If this function returns success, the caller should at some point call `nscq_dlwrap_detach()` to
unload the library and free any resources allocated by the `dlwrap` layer.

== `nscq_dlwrap_detach`

This thread-safe function uses an OS-specific API like `dlclose()` to unmap the NSCQ shared library
from the calling process's address space. This function and `nscq_dlwrap_attach()` do not do any
reference counting, so this function only needs to be called once to unload the library and free
any resources allocated by the `dlwrap` layer.
